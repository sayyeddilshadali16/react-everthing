# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
ide javascript

====

react js a library used to build single website with reusable UI components
library with limited featurs
frameworks comes with complete architecture

export modules are of two types

named - just name and export and while import must be carefully import including case sensitivity in {} braces
default - each file default identity and can be imported by any name

- real dom vs virtual dom

change in element from the tree of real dom takes entire document to re-render.

change happens real dom take place in the copy of real dom and then compares it with real dom and then updates it

- jsx javascript xml

allow to write html inside javascript

- eslint

collabrative coding, using github, faces problems -> diff people writes code in diff style which creates conflict while merging code to avoid eslint is used, where we can define custom rules for code formatting.

- gitignore

untrack file from git

- components

the ui gets broken into modular and reusable components. it can be composed and nested to create complex UI structure.

- props
